<p>Welcome to www.kernel-seeds.org, the home of pre-made kernel seeds to help you get your Linux system up and running.</p>

<p>I read somewhere that the Linux kernel is a lonely place to be without a map. This is so true. When you have no idea what needs to be set up as modules, what needs to be compiled in the kernel, and so on, it's hard to figure out what to do with which setting. That doesn't even take into account which settings to use and which to avoid like the plague.</p>

<p>Simply put, there are a lot of choices to consider when setting up the kernel. With all the choices comes a lot of confusion, especially for the n00b who is just coming off his or her Microsoft habit. While Gentoo users have genkernel as an option, it tends to set up bloated, module-heavy kernels by default. The unnecessary modules and drivers, etc, can cause slowdowns at boot and during operation, or driver conflicts. That can lead to lockups, slow downs, and less than stable operation.</p>

<p>Enter the kernel seed.</p>

<p>The basic idea of the kernel seed is that all the tough stuff has already been set up. The basics for a standard desktop system configuration, basic network operation, and other settings have been set for stable systemic usability. All you, the user, have left to do is to plug in the required hardware devices, compile, and you have a functional kernel.</p> 

<p>The kernel seeds are tweaked with all the settings I use on my personal systems. When you use one of Pappy's Kernel Seeds, you're effectively using my system settings with your devices. Since it's fairly obvious that my systems are working well enough to do what it takes to get a web page set up, edit it, and run it on my own server, the settings I use ought to work for every x86 and x86_64 system. Since I set my systems for speed and stability, you get both from Pappy's kernel seeds.</p>

<p>I don't just make seeds, I use them. That's right, the settings you see are the settings I use. From the laptop I'm using to edit this document, to the server that puts it out to the public, to the x86 distfiles server, to the x86_64 kernel source configuration machine, all my machines are running kernel seeds.</p>

<p>I have recently added the first of several pages that explain the kernel seed settings, and the ideas behind them. Now you can know what the settings are, and why I chose them.</p>
